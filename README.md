# Wheat-Plant-Disease-Detection
Wheat Disease Detection using CNN
Overview
This project involves detecting diseases in wheat plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to build a binary classification model that can classify wheat leaves as either healthy or diseased based on their images.

Key Features:
CNN-based image classification model
Binary classification: Healthy vs Diseased
Image augmentation for training data
Model saved in .h5 format for easy deployment
