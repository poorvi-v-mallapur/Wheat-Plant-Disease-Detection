# Wheat Plant Disease Detection using CNN
This project involves detecting diseases in wheat plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to build a binary classification model that can classify wheat leaves as either healthy or diseased based on their images.

**Key Features:**<br>
-CNN-based image classification model<br>
-Binary classification: Healthy vs Diseased<br>
-Image augmentation for training data<br>
-Model saved in .h5 format for easy deployment<br>

**Requirements:**<br>
To run this project, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can install all dependencies by using the provided requirements.txt.<br>

1. Python 3.x<br>
2. TensorFlow (for deep learning model)<br>
3. Keras (part of TensorFlow)<br>
4. NumPy (for numerical operations)<br>
5. Pandas (for data manipulation)<br>
6. Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)<br>
